###Treasure hunt protected from reverse engineering

Treasure hunt with multiple HTML elements usually has to rely on the server side to hide the 'key.' Unless the right pick is hidden away from the client side, anyone can view the source code, and easily pick the treasure apart from other non-treasure elements. 

This sie is a client-side only solution for enforcing the treasure hunt to be a visual search by a human being without the need of a server. The use of hash does allow a degree of brute forcing method for solution searching, but it is guaranteed to be much less efficient than the intended visual treasure search.

This is an experimental prototype, and if you find any vulnurabilities, please create an 'Issue' under this repo. Your venerable username will be remembered forever under the credits.
